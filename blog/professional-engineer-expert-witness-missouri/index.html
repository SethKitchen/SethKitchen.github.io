When technical questions are central to a matter, courts and attorneys may rely on expert testimony to understand engineering principles, system behavior, and technical causation.</p><p class="text-gray-700">In Missouri, a licensed Professional Engineer may serve as an expert witness when the subject matter falls within the engineer’s area of competence and the opinions offered are based on sufficient technical analysis.</p><p class="text-gray-700">This article describes the role of an engineering expert witness and the professional responsibilities that accompany that role.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-3">What an Engineering Expert Witness Does</h2><p class="text-gray-700">An engineering expert witness provides independent technical opinions to assist the court or other decision-makers. This role is distinct from advocacy and is grounded in objective engineering analysis.</p><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Typical expert witness activities may include:</p><ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6 mt-3"><li>Reviewing technical documents, drawings, and records</li><li>Evaluating system design, operation, and failure modes</li><li>Analyzing data, logs, and test results</li><li>Preparing written expert reports</li><li>Providing deposition or trial testimony</li></ul><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">The expert’s duty is to the facts and engineering principles, not to a particular outcome.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-3">Independence and Professional Judgment</h2><p class="text-gray-700">Professional engineers serving as expert witnesses are ethically obligated to remain independent and unbiased. Opinions must be formed through analysis rather than instruction from counsel or clients.</p><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Key elements of professional judgment in expert work include:</p><ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6 mt-3"><li>Clear distinction between facts, assumptions, and opinions</li><li>Use of accepted engineering methods</li><li>Disclosure of limitations or uncertainties</li><li>Avoidance of conclusions beyond available evidence</li></ul><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Maintaining independence is essential for credibility and admissibility.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-3">Engineering Expertise and Modern Systems</h2><p class="text-gray-700">Many disputes today involve complex systems that include software, control logic, or distributed components. Expert evaluation of such systems often requires understanding both theoretical design and real-world operation.</p><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Expert witness work in these cases may involve:</p><ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6 mt-3"><li>Reconstruction of system behavior over time</li><li>Evaluation of control or decision logic</li><li>Analysis of interactions between software and physical components</li><li>Review of verification and validation practices</li></ul><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Engineering expertise must be applied in a manner that is clear and accessible to non-technical audiences without oversimplifying the underlying analysis.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-3">Legal Standards and Professional Responsibility</h2><p class="text-gray-700">While legal standards for expert testimony vary by jurisdiction, professional engineers are governed by ethical and licensure obligations regardless of venue.</p><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">In Missouri, engineers must:</p><ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6 mt-3"><li>Practice within their area of competence</li><li>Avoid misleading statements or omissions</li><li>Maintain honesty and objectivity</li><li>Accept responsibility for opinions offered</li></ul><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Failure to adhere to these principles can affect both professional credibility and licensure.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-3">When an Engineering Expert May Be Needed</h2><p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">An engineering expert witness may be appropriate when:</p><ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6"><li>Technical causation is disputed</li><li>Engineering standards or practices are questioned</li><li>System behavior is not readily understood by non-engineers</li><li>Independent analysis is required to inform decision-making</li></ul><p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">Early technical evaluation can often clarify issues and narrow the scope of disputes.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-3">Closing</h2><p class="text-gray-700">This article is intended to provide general information about the role of Professional Engineers as expert witnesses in Missouri.
