						<p>Put 2,100 into Robinhood Gold Stock Trading Account.</p>
						<p>On BUY days, pull S&P 500 tickers for the last 20 years and use DeepAR neural network to predict individually the next 7 days mean value with level of uncertainty.</p>
						<p>Calculate the largest percent change (maxValue(7days)-startDay)/startDay * 100 for each and sort the table descending.</p>
						<p>Invest some in each of the top percent change predictions as long as uncertainty is relatively small.</p>
						<p>Place limit sell for half of (maxValue(7days)-startDay)+startDay.</p>
						<p>Record whether successful or not. If after 1 month the limit sell is never reached sell anyway.</p>

								<h3>Stocks are booming they said.... <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html">New York Times</a>.</h3>
								<img width="400px" src="images/april29changeuncert.PNG" />
								<h3>Here are the projected percent growth changes with corresponding uncertainties given by the neural network.</h3>
								<p>From this we can see Arconic and Apache lead the pack. </p>

								<p>One problem to note already is the predictions take most of the day to create. By the time these results were calculated, the market was closed.</p>
								<p>It may be a good sign Arconic went up 7.4%, Apache up 22.31% today, but we expect it to be before these gains for our initial prediction. We should've invested at the beginning of the day!</p>
								<p>We will rerun overnight tonight with the changes and the data may or may not change.</p>

								<h3>Buy Arconic (ARNC)</h3>
								<img width="400px" src="images/april30changeuncert.PNG" />
								<h3>Here are the projected percent growth changes with corresponding uncertainties given by the neural network.</h3>
								<p>From this we can see Arconic is still expected to grow from 8.59 to 11.07 in the next week </p>
								<img width="400px" src="images/april30arnc.PNG" />
								<p>Therefore I put a limit order in for $9 and the order went through at 150 @ 8.75 ($1312.50). Actually near the start of the market ARNC went as low as 8.39 which is very close to the prediction of 8.59. I could have put the limit lower.</p>
								<p>I put a limit sell at 10.29 which the net is predicting should sell Monday (5/4) or Tuesday (5/5). This is a fraction of the 11.07 it expects within 7 days and is a safe play with huge reward (+231, 17.6%). </p>
								<p>Not using all 2,100 leaves room to invest in more after running today/tonight.</p>
